Data Requirements:
To create an account with FacePage, the user must choose a unique username that is not already existing for either a personal or business account.
If a business account is chosen, the user must list a company name and pay a monthly fee. Business accounts have the option to create an 
advertisement page, but it is not required. If a personal account is chosen, they may send/receive friend requests, unlike business accounts.
Both business and personal accounts are not allowed to create multiple accounts, but they are allowed to create multiple pages. These pages are not 
allowed to have the same name under an account.
